# Snapchat Clone using Digital Image Processing

## Overview
This project is a real-time Snapchat like face filter application developed using Python and OpenCV.
It captures live webcam feed, detects faces using Haar Cascade Classifier, and applies multiple
image processing filters in real time.

## Features
- Real-time face detection
- 18 image processing filters (Gaussian, Sobel, Laplacian, Canny, Sepia, etc.)
- Accessory overlays (glasses, hat) with aspect ratio preservation
- Keyboard controlled filter switching

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Haar Cascade Classifier
